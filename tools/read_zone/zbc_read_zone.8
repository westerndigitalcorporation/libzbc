.SH NAME
zbc_read_zone \- Read sectors of a zone of a ZBC or ZAC device

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zbc_read_zone
[options]
.IR device
.IR zone_number
.IR IO_size

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zbc_read_zone
is used to read sectors from a zone of a ZBC or ZAC device. By default, the
target zone will be read starting from the first sector of the zone. For
sequential zones, the default behavior is to read all sectors up to the zone
write pointer position. For conventional zones, all sectors are read.

.PP
The
.I device
argument must be the pathname to the target device block device file (e.g.,
.IR /dev/sdb "),"
or to the target device SG node file (e.g.,
.IR /dev/sg3 ")."
On old kernels lacking ZBC and ZAC support, only the device SG node file will
be available. The target device may also be a regular block device set to
emulate zones with the \fBzbc_set_zones\fP utility.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be specified.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display a usage help message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v
Verbose mode (for debugging problems).
.TP
.BR \-dio
Use direct IO operations.
.TP
.BR \-vio " " \fInum\fR
Use vectored IO with \fBnum\fR buffers of
.I IO_size
bytes, resulting in an actual I/O size of \fBnum\fR x
.I IO_size
bytes.
.TP
.BR \-nio " " \fInum\fR
Limit the number of I/O executed to \fBnum\fR.
.TP
.BR \-p " " \fInum\fR
Expect all bytes that are read to have the value \fBnum\fR. In case of a
mismatch, the offset of the bytes with the incorrect value is printed.
.TP
.BR \-f " " \fIfile\fR
Write the data read from the zone to \fBfile\fR. If \fBfile\fR is "\fB-\fR",
the data read is printed to the standard output.
.TP
.BR \-ofst " " \fIofst\fR
Read the zone from the sector offset \fBofst\fR instead of from the start of
the zone.
